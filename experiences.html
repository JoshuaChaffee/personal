        <ul class="accomplishments">
            <li>I made the honor roll multiple times throughout middle school and graduated to high school</li>
            <li>Almost got all A's in my freshman year when I was getting used to high school.</li>
            <li>Did well on my very first interview</li>
                <h3 class="career">What I Want To Do</h3>
                  <p class="job">Like I said earlier, I want to be involved with anything about  video games and mostly Nintendo related games. I want to learn how to create games and if I can't do that for them then I would at least try for a well paying job at Nintendo in general. If I can't do either then I might attempt to make video game content for YouTube.</p>
